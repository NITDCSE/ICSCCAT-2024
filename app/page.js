            Over the last two decades, the realm of computing and communication has notably expanded, 
            encompassing a diverse array of facets. Computing involves designing, developing and building 
            hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; 
            doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; 
            and creating and using communications and entertainment media.<br />
              <br />
            Secure cyber computing refers to the practice of ensuring the security, confidentiality, integrity,
             and availability of computing systems, networks, and data in the digital realm. 
             It involves a comprehensive set of strategies, practices, and technologies aimed at safeguarding 
             digital assets from various cyber threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities. It includes a range of 
             measures designed to protect information, systems, and users from unauthorized access, data breaches, 
             cyberattacks, and other security risks.
             <br /> <br />
            "Advanced technology" refers to cutting-edge, highly developed, and innovative tools, techniques, or systems 
            that represent the forefront of scientific and technological progress in a particular field. These technologies 
            often involve a significant departure from traditional methods and bring about new capabilities, efficiencies, 
            and possibilities that were previously not achievable. The integration of AI in various area of research including 
            data analysis, security, computing environment and healthcare brings about innovative solutions and capabilities 
            that were previously not possible using traditional methods.

                  Planners in the healthcare sector and
                  government health institutions are looking to technology to deliver healthcare
                  that is smarter, faster, and more responsive. The healthcare industry has
                  benefited greatly from this technological development, which has improved
                  the efficiency and security of patient treatment. Healthcare professionals are
                  progressively adopting new digital trends, such as wearable gadgets that allow
                  patients to supplement their health data and networked equipment that
                  enable remote monitoring and patient care. This track provides the
                  opportunity to learn the recent research trends and future scope of smart
                  healthcare.
